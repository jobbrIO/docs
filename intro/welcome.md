# Welcome

This is the documentation for the .NET JobServer Jobbr. Feel free to contribute by editing this page or head to one of our repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/JobbrIO).

## Features

* Embeddable in your own C# application (job server and executor)
* Isolation of Jobs on process-level
* REST API and typed client to manage and trigger Jobs and watch the execution state
* Persists created files from jobruns in an artefact store
* Supports CRON expressions for recurring triggers

Open the [Features](features.md) page for a more extensive and detailed features list.


## Motivation

Our goal is to provide a library that allows you to host your own job server wherever you want and without any compromises regarding dependencies and versions, logger-abstractions, storage implementations, extendibility and stability. At the bare-minimum a Jobbr job server, its execution engine and storage, can be run in-memory.
