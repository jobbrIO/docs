# Architecture
## Framework vs. Library
We're a library that enables running a JobServer but not a standalone server....

## Extendability
Concept of component models, Registration, different NuGet Packages, reasoining

List of CM and responsabilities? Very short to give an overview what is abstracted...

Picture and reasoning, can contain infos from meeting notes

--> Link to internas (if you want to implement a Component)
